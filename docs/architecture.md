INTRODUCTION

This project implements a fault-tolerant distributed payment processing system. Clients submit payments to any server node, which ensures that transactions are recorded consistently across all nodes using replication and consensus mechanisms. Time synchronization and logging ensure event ordering and debugging accuracy.
